Social media went from exciting to being ingrained in our societies and its influence exceeded the personal sphere to attain even our legal framework and political institutions. The question of regulating social networks is currently a hot topic especially with the rise of the concept of cyber warfare and what that entails in terms of disruption and propaganda. It is therefore very important to study how social media can be used to create narratives and tip the scales into one way or the other. In particular, the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll factory was accused of interfering in multiple foreign political processes like the the 2016 US presidential elections. We dispose of a dataset of roughly 3 millions tweets spanned between 2012 and 2018 related to accounts of this agency. The aim is to understand what these tweets focus on and how do they adapt with respect to major political and politically divisive events.


You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

``` ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
